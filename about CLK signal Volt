Datasheets show almost all of 5V ic need more than 4.0V clock VIH， and 8284 can send out 3.9V+， use pld rebuild the clock module，
at least need pull up res.

But after test, max7000s can drive nec v20 work well. It is necessery try to build a pld and d/p8088 min_system. 

I have designed a pull up 10k res, 0805 package, if max7000s vccio link 3.3v, I am worry about the voh is too low to drive CLK.
