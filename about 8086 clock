Some informations show 8086/88 use a low speed clock also run well. I guess 4-8Mhz link to 8086-2 is ok，but frozen clk fail. Use fpga
make a div_clock module， after test I will write down exact answer. perhaps D8086, P8086, compatible chip are different.

Use max7000s cpld, I have get a 4.17Mhz, 33% duty cycle signal(50Mhz / 12), succeeded in running this min_system.

Because of cpld's erasing times， I don't want change src many times, so use a fpga output different speed clk to cpld, and cpld div
it to cpu, the volt 3.3v trans to 5v(Voh ~ 3.6v).
